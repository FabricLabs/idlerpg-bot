# idlerpg-bot
Simple chatbot implementing IdleRPG, a pointless game rewarding users for
inactivity.

## Quick Start
Copy `config.json.sample` to `config.json` and change to suit your needs.

Configuration values include `services`, which can be configured to support any
Doorman service â€” as of this writing, this includes `slack`, `matrix`, and
`discord`.

`interval` specifies the "tick" interval in milliseconds.

## Support
If you need help, please [open an issue][issues].
